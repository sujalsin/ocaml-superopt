# OCaml Bytecode Superoptimizer

A tool for generating optimal OCaml bytecode sequences through exhaustive search and formal verification.

## Overview

This superoptimizer works by:
1. Taking an input bytecode sequence
2. Generating equivalent candidate sequences
3. Verifying their equivalence using the Z3 SMT solver
4. Evaluating their efficiency using a configurable cost model
5. Selecting the most efficient verified sequence

## Features

- Exhaustive search for optimal bytecode sequences
- Formal verification using Z3 SMT solver
- Configurable cost model based on instruction size and cycles
- Command-line interface for easy integration
- Support for processing both individual sequences and bytecode files

## Requirements

- OCaml (>= 4.14.0)
- Dune (>= 3.0)
- Core (>= v0.15.0)
- Core_bench (>= v0.15.0)
- Z3 (>= 4.8.13)
- PPX extensions (ppx_jane, ppx_expect)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
opam install dune core core_bench z3 ppx_jane ppx_expect
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
dune build
```

## Usage

Basic usage with default parameters:
```bash
dune exec ocaml-superopt
```

Optimize a specific bytecode file:
```bash
dune exec ocaml-superopt -- -input bytecode.txt
```

Configure optimization parameters:
```bash
dune exec ocaml-superopt -- -max-length 6 -size-weight 1.5 -cycle-weight 2.0
```

## Cost Model

The cost model considers two factors:
- Instruction size (in bytes)
- Estimated CPU cycles

The weights for these factors can be adjusted using command-line flags.

## Implementation Details

- `src/types.ml`: Core data structures
- `src/bytecode_generator.ml`: Instruction sequence generation
- `src/verification.ml`: Z3-based equivalence checking
- `src/main.ml`: Command-line interface and optimization logic

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas for improvement include:
- Adding support for more bytecode instructions
- Improving the cost model with real-world measurements
- Optimizing the search algorithm
- Adding support for parallel search
- Implementing more sophisticated verification techniques
